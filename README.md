My plan is to clean up my repositories by having multiple branches in fewer repositories, rather than multiple repositories with no branches. In time, you should be able to view all of the previous repositories by looking under the branches here.

Added so far:
AOKP MM 6.0.1
PAC MM 6.0.1
Slim MM 6.0.1
AOKP N 7.0.1
RR N 7.1.0
Slim N 7.1.1 Build 0.7
